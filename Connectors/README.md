# Photos

Here are a couple of photos to show you how I connected the individual modules (four 8x8 modules in each strip).

The INPUT (the bit connected to the microcontroller) has a standard 5-pin header.

The interconnecting pins between modules consisted of a 5-pin header that had been soldered on one end, bent over so the longer pins went into the neighbouring module and soldered.

Additionally, I soldered _under_ the board too, just to absolutely ensure a better (and strong) connection.

That said, they physical strengthe of these pin headers is not great, so I screwed the modules onto a small board. Easy to do and ensures 100% physical integrity with no strain on the PCB or copper tracks.
